# BlockShuffleRace
Minecraft Plugin - Block Shuffle Race!!! (Multiple Players)

Block Shuffle Race is finally up! I couldn't find this version of block shuffle (Dream's version is timer-based), so I created it myself!

Each time a new game is started, a randomized list of blocks will be created (unbeknownst to any of the players); each player will be given the first block in the list. Each time a player has found the block in interest, they will be given the next block to find. The first player who collects (i.e. has stood on) all the blocks in order wins.

Start Command:
/blockshufflestart [number of blocks to search for] [player1] [player2] [player3] ...

Stop Command:
/blockshufflestop

Block List Reveal Command (Only Reveals to the Command Writer):
/blockshufflelist
